# GEM5, A Short tutorial. 
GEM5 simulator dedicated for  computer architecture research that encompass system and process level microarchitecture. It is a merge of the best aspects of  M5 and GEM5. The simulator is highly confiugrable and includes multiple CPU and ISA (ARM, MIPS, x86, ... etc) models. The project is a result of joined efforts from AMD, ARM, HP, MIPS, Princeton, MIT,and the universities of Texas, Wisconsin, and Michigan  an open source and mainly written in C++ and python.
